        Poseidon sat at his desk and kept accounts. Managing all the world's waterbodies gave him endless work. He could have
        had as many assistants as he wanted&mdash;and indeed he had many&mdash;but since he took his work very seriously, he was
        calculating everything again, so his assistants couldn't help him much. No one could say that he liked his work; he only
        did it because he had to. Indeed, he'd already tried multiple times to apply for something more&mdash;as he expressed
        it&mdash;enjoyable, but every time he was suggested some other positions, it became eminently clear that no other position
        appealed to him like his previous one. It was also very difficult for him to find anything else. After all, he couldn't
        just be assigned a particular ocean, for instance. Only a magisterial position was fit for the great Poseidon; never
        mind that his current computational work, while not trivial, was still provincial. And when offered a position away from
        the waters, he grew ill just from the image, such that his divine breath wavered and his iron ribcage shook. These
        appeals were scarcely taken to heart. Yet when the Mighty anguish, one must try to feign submission in even the most
        desperate matters. No one was seriously thinking of relieving Poseidon of his position; he was designated god of the sea
        long ago and was to remain as such.

        What put him out most of all&mdash;and accounted for the bulk of his discontent&mdash;was hearing the notions people had of him,
        like that he was always riding upon the main, trident at hand. Meanwhile, here he sat at the bottom of the ocean, always
        calculating and never breaking the tedium but for the occasional trip to Jupiter&mdash;a trip, by the way, from which he
        would most often come back enraged. Consequently, he hardly ever saw the seas, except fleetingly on his hurried ascents
        to Mount Olympus; he never actually rode through them. He used to say he was waiting for the end times, which might
        allow him a still moment after reviewing his last calculation to make a quick, preterminal round of the world.
